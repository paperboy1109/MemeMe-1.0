# MemeMe 1.0

This is an iPhone app that I made for my Udacity iOS Nanodegree.  As per Udacity's description the app "enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email."

# Version History

Pitch Perfect was originally developed using Xcode 7 and Swift 2.2, but has been updated to work with **Xcode 8.0** and **Swift 3.0**.
